### Contribute with code
To contribute with code you should follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch out of develop. If it is related to a issue from the original repository, start the branch name with the # symbol followed by the issue number.
3. Write the code, commit and merge into your develop branch and make sure it builds and all tests passes.
4. Create a Pull Request from your branch to the original repository, describing which changes your code did.
5. Wait for code review and apply any requested changes.

### Test guidelines
We encourage that you write automated tests to all the code you would like to write.
Any publicly exposed methods should have integration tests.
